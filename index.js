// things to keep in mind: factory functions, write efficient code, build the base first

// gameBoard: take gameBoard and associate each gameCell with an index in an 2d array
    // take the marker that user has selected
    // write the code to display the marker to the selected cell and associate the same in the appropriate place inside an array
    // stop the game if someone won
    // And display result

// write logic of winning

// displaying results

// restart game
